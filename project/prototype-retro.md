Rapid Prototype Phase - Retro Notes

What Went Well 
(Noah)
- Discovered improvements needed for the Dialogue Engine
- Core is separated out
- Communication was good

(Silas)
- Forward moving work
- No redesigns needed
- High-performance gameplay

(Jonathan)
- Design tasks were on point
- Flexible schedule for working
- Git flows works painfree

(Gordy)
- Ideation/Brainstorming was fantastic
- Felt safe pulling down the code


What Didn't Go Well
(Noah)
- Scope was way too massive
- Cost a lot of time integrating the Dialogue Engine
- Dialogue Engine integration and tooling is fragile
- We didn't get far enough to determine if the game is fun

(Silas)
- Massive scope
- Project milestones and flow felt haphazard
- Some idea weren't well communicated to the team

(Jonathan)
- Idea wasn't clear until midway through Saturday

(Gordy)
- Unable to test much content
- Failure as a prototype


What We Can Do To Improve
(Noah)
- Build out Game Jam Template
- Figure out how to better create Milestones and improve as a Project Manager
- Don't tool-jam. Game jam. 

(Gordy)
- We should improve Testing milestones
- Publish annoucement about Key Feature complete, and about Project Milestone complete

(Silas)
- Focus on the core game feeling and not all the mechanics

(Jonathan)
- If time spent is an off-role, consider if something is different
